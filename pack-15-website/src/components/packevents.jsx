          Our pack is a very active pack. We plan at least 1 Pack level activity
          every month, including through the summer months. We want to keep the
          scouts as active and engaged as possible. Here are some examples of
          activities we have done in the past:

          <div className='subcontenttitle'>Recruiting Luau</div>
          <div className='subcontent'>
            Each summer we host a pack Luau. This is a chance for the Scouts to
            have one last get together before the school year kicks off. It is
            also a chance for potential Scouts to come see what the Pack is all
            about. The potential Scout can get to know their fellow Scouts while
            their parents can get to know the Pack leadership and ask any
            questions they may have.

          <div className='subcontent'>
            On your mark. Get Set. GEAUX!!!! The Scout Olympics is our first
            official Pack gathering each year. Dens will participate in a number
            of events such as an obstacle course, 40 yard dash, high jump, and
            more! This is a great chance for everyone to blow off some of that
            "Back to School" steam while rooting on their fellow Scouts to "Do
            Their Best".

          <div className='subcontenttitle'>Popcorn Sale</div>
          <div className='subcontent'>
            The popcorn campaign runs from August through October, with
            deliveries in November. This is the Scout's opportunity to develop
            their public speaking skills while selling delicious popcorn and
            working toward prizes. Through the month of October, the Pack will
            host several weekend "Show and Sells" outside of local businesses.
            Scouts can sign up for shifts on days that work for them and earn
            Scout Bucks. The Pack will also set aside a percentage of each
            Scout's sales for them to use towards their yearly fees! In addition
            to Scout Bucks, the more popcorn you sell, the more prizes you can
            select at the end of the campaign! And if you are the lucky Scout
            that sells the most popcorn in your Den, there is a special reward.
            Past rewards have included pieing the Cubmaster in the face, pizza
            party with the other high sellers, and more! We try to come up with
            a new incentive each year.

          <div className='subcontenttitle'>Fall/Spring Camp Outs</div>
          <div className='subcontent'>
            Scouting is an outdoor-based program. When you ask new Scouts what
            they are looking forward to the most, the answer is almost always
            "Camping!". The Pack goes on 2 camp outs a year. Typically those
            occur in October and March each year. This is a great opportunity
            for Scouts to earn adventure loops as well as learn fundamental
            skills about camping. It is also a great opportunity for the Scouts
            to spend extended time with their fellow Den and Pack members
            building strong relationships.
            <br />
            <br />
            Camping is not just for the Scouts though. We did not forget about
            the adults! Each camp out has a special event just for the adults:{' '}
            <b>The Great Cobbler Cook Off</b>! All of the adults are invited to
            show off their camp fire cooking chops in our bi-annual cobbler cook
            off. The winner will receive the coveted Wooden Paddle and sign it
            etching their legacy in history for eternity!

            Scouts are provided a BSA Rocket Kit to build and decorate how they
            want. We then gather on launch day and have the Scouts send their
            rockets skyward!

          <div className='subcontent'>
            Each year the Pack participates in the Jones Creek Christmas Parade
            hosted by the Jones Creek Area Business Association. Scouts dress up
            in their Class A's to wish everyone along the parade route a Merry
            Christmas.

            One Sunday in December we gather to spread Holiday Cheer through the

          <div className='subcontenttitle'>Pinewood Derby</div>
          <div className='subcontent'>
            The Pinewood Derby is one of the most popular and successful family
            activities in Cub Scouting. In December, each Scout will receive a
            derby car kit from a special visitor to design and build their own
            car to race against their fellow Den members. The Pack will also
            have a special Pack Build Day where Scouts can come and design their
            car with the Pack. Tools like band saws, sanders, and drill presses
            will be available for those that do not have them at home. Scouts
            receive awards for best looking, wildest design, and for the results
            of their Den race. Then, the winners of each Den will race against
            each other to see who is the fastest in the Pack!
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to the Scout's derby races, there is also an outlaw
            division for Scouts, Siblings, and Parents! Rules are tweaked and
            it's a "Run what you brung" challenge for all! The winner gets
            bragging rights for the next year and sign the Wagner Wheel Trophy
            to live in infamy.

          <div className='subcontenttitle'>Blue & Gold Banquet</div>
          <div className='subcontent'>
            Each year, in February, the Cub Scouts celebrate the anniversary of
            the founding of the BSA, on February 8, 1910, by having a Blue and
            Gold Banquet. This event is for the entire family, including
            grandparents and other special guests that want to share in your
            Scout's achievements. This is where each Scout will "Rank Up" and
            receive their new Rank Badge that they have been working towards all
            year. But more importantly, this day is a special day for the 2nd
            year AOL "Arrow of Light" WEBELOS as it is their final day of being
            a Cub Scout. During the banquet, AOLs will be invited by a
            Scoutmaster to join a Scouts BSA Troop in a "crossing-over"
            ceremony. Scouts MUST wear their full Class A uniform.

          <div className='subcontent'>
            The Rain Gutter Regatta is the aquatic version of the Pinewood
            Derby. Each Scout will receive an official Rain Gutter Regatta
            Trimaran kit which includes: Racing Trimaran Hull, two outriggers,
            sail, mast, screws and sanding stick. Within the basic design rules,
            Scouts are free to paint and decorate their sailboats as they
            choose. The boats are raced in a standard rain gutter that is ten
            feet long, placed on a table or saw horses, and filled to the top
            with water. The boats are propelled by blowing on the sail, either
            directly or through a drinking straw; the boat cannot be touched
            with hands or the straw.

          <div className='subcontent'>
            School can be stressful for the Scouts. Each year the Pack gathers
            to give the Scouts a chance to blow off some mid year stress
            together. We will play games such as capture the flag, protect the
            president, and more. The Scouts get 2 hours of all out fun to reset
            for the final push to the end of the school year.

            Each year the Pack tries to coordinate with a local group of First
            Responders to give a safety presentation to the Scouts. Past demos
            have included the St. George Fire Department and Louisiana State
            Police.

            We like to stay busy through the summer months. Some Dens continue
            meeting and the Pack continues getting together once each month. We
            have been fortunate to have some really cool adventures over the
            years. Some examples include:
            <ul className='packevents'>

                NASA Scout Camp out
                <div className='regular'>
                  Scouts had an opportunity to camp overnight under a twice
                  flown Falcon 9 Rocket or the Space Shuttle Independence and
                  the 747 shuttle carrier that transported the Space Shuttle
                  between sites during the shuttle program. They were also
                  granted exclusive after hours access to the Space Center
                  Houston for a number of guided learning activities.
                  Participants also received free entry to the Museum to explore
                  at their leisure on day 2.
